# overview

In this project we plan the trip and save, delete the trip, we also check how many days left, weatherforecast, temp for the trip. We fetch data from 4 apis to display the trip which are dependant on each other.
This project that excercised my ability to navigate through the module bundler, 'Webpack'. The result of which is a weather app and express/ node.js driven application.

# 4 Apis used

- `paxabay`
- `weatherbit.io`
- `restcountries`
- `geonames`

# how to use:

- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm run build-dev` or `yarn run build-dev`
- `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in server.js
